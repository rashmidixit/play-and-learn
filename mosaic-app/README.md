# Mosaic Application

This application displays cards in a mosaid layout using CSS flex. 

## How to Build, Deploy and Test

### Pre-requisites

- This has been tested on the following environment. Ensure you have at least these versions of the following installed.
    - node v12.13.0
    - npm v6.12.0

### Build

Run `npm install` to install all required node packages.
Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.  

## Future Enhancements

### Technical Debt

- The problem statement states that for mobile landscape, there should be 
2 cards in a row. However, that still needs to be handled.
- Test cases need to be added to test the cards are coming in the right order.
